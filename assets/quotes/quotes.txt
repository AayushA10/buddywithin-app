You are stronger than you think.
Your story isn’t over yet.
You’ve survived 100% of your hardest days.
Even the darkest night ends with sunrise.
Healing is not linear. It’s still progress.
Don’t believe everything you think.
You matter, and your presence makes a difference.
Start where you are. Use what you have. Do what you can.
